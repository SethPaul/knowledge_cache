# Reduced Scope MCP Server - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Vision

Build a **highly polished, production-ready MCP server** focused exclusively on the **4 core tools** that provide maximum value to AI agents working with codebase knowledge.

Based on analysis of the existing codebase and the [AWS MCP blog insights](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/unlocking-the-power-of-model-context-protocol-mcp-on-aws/), this reduced scope will solve the "M√óN integration problem" for codebase intelligence with enterprise-grade reliability.

## üìã What to Keep from Existing Work

### ‚úÖ **Excellent Patterns to Preserve**

#### **1. Hierarchical Scope Architecture**
```python
# From: components/knowledge_store/src/knowledge_store/models.py
class ScopeLevel(str, Enum):
    PROJECT = "project"
    DOMAIN = "domain"  
    MODULE = "module"
    FILE = "file"

# Usage: "project.components.knowledge_store.api"
```
**Why Keep**: Perfect for efficient querying and knowledge organization

#### **2. Freshness Management with Timestamps**
```python
# From: components/knowledge_store/src/knowledge_store/models.py  
class FreshnessInfo(BaseModel):
    staleness_seconds: float
    freshness_category: FreshnessCategory
    scope_last_change: datetime
    analysis_timestamp: datetime
    scope_path: str
    scope_level: ScopeLevel
    freshness_score: float = Field(..., ge=0.0, le=1.0)
    recommendations: List[str]
```
**Why Keep**: Transparent, actionable freshness information for agents

#### **3. Content Addressing for Change Detection**
```python
# From: components/knowledge_store/src/knowledge_store/models.py
class AnalysisResult(BaseModel):
    content_hash: str = Field(..., description="Hash of source content")
    dependencies_hash: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Hash of dependency inputs")
```
**Why Keep**: Efficient change detection without expensive re-analysis

#### **4. Structured Logging Pattern**
```python
# From: mvp/mvp/server.py
structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level,
        structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name,
        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer()
    ]
)
```
**Why Keep**: Production-ready observability

#### **5. MCP Tool Schema Structure**
```python
# From: mvp/mcp_stdio_server.py
{
    "name": "search_project_knowledge",
    "description": "Search across project documentation and design decisions",
    "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"},
            "scope_filter": {"type": "string", "description": "Optional scope filter"},
            "limit": {"type": "integer", "description": "Max results", "default": 10}
        },
        "required": ["query"]
    }
}
```
**Why Keep**: Clear, standardized interface for agent integration

### ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure to Preserve**

#### **PostgreSQL + pgvector Foundation**
- **Database Schema**: Hierarchical storage with vector search
- **Connection Pooling**: asyncpg for performance
- **Vector Operations**: pgvector for semantic search

#### **FastAPI + Pydantic Stack**
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models for validation
- **Async Operations**: FastAPI for concurrent handling
- **Auto Documentation**: Built-in schema generation

#### **Redis Caching Strategy**
- **Multi-Level Cache**: L1 (memory) ‚Üí L2 (Redis) ‚Üí L3 (PostgreSQL)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Scope-based invalidation patterns

---

## ‚ùå **What to Remove/Simplify**

### **1. Complex Bootstrap System**
**Current**: 4 bootstrap tools with complex progress tracking
**New**: Simple, synchronous analysis on-demand
**Reason**: Adds complexity without core value for 4-tool focus

### **2. Multiple Server Implementations**
**Current**: FastAPI HTTP + stdio + potential SSE
**New**: Focus on **stdio only** for MCP compliance
**Reason**: stdio is the standard, others add maintenance overhead

### **3. Document-Specific Models**
**Current**: Separate DocumentAnalysis, DesignDecision models
**New**: Unified AnalysisResult for all content types
**Reason**: Simpler data model for broader content support

### **4. Complex Component System**
**Current**: 5 separate components (bootstrap_analyzer, change_detector, etc.)
**New**: Single, focused knowledge store
**Reason**: Over-engineered for 4-tool scope

### **5. Multiple Configuration Systems**
**Current**: Environment files, YAML configs, multiple initialization paths
**New**: Simple environment-based configuration
**Reason**: Reduces complexity and failure points

---

## üèóÔ∏è **New Architecture Design**

### **Simplified Component Structure**
```
reduced_scope/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py              # MCP stdio server (single entry point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge_store.py     # Core storage operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py              # Focused data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ freshness.py           # Timestamp-based freshness management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ search.py              # Semantic search operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py              # Simple environment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.sql             # Database schema (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Focused test suite
```

### **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **server.py**: MCP protocol handling only
- **knowledge_store.py**: CRUD operations only
- **search.py**: Search algorithm only
- **freshness.py**: Timestamp management only

### **Performance-First Design**
- **Connection Pooling**: Single asyncpg pool, shared across operations
- **Query Optimization**: Prepared statements for core queries
- **Cache Strategy**: Redis for hot data, PostgreSQL for cold storage
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk inserts and updates where possible

---

## üéØ **Key Learnings to Apply**

### **1. Agent-Centric Design**
**Learning**: Agents need clear confidence scores and actionable recommendations
**Application**: Every response includes freshness info and next-step guidance

### **2. Failure Isolation**
**Learning**: Individual tool failures shouldn't cascade
**Application**: Each tool has independent error handling and graceful degradation

### **3. Transparent Performance**
**Learning**: Agents make better decisions with timing information
**Application**: Include query_duration_ms in all responses

### **4. Hierarchical Efficiency**
**Learning**: Scope-based operations are much more efficient than file-based
**Application**: All operations organized around hierarchical scopes

### **5. Content Addressing Benefits**
**Learning**: Hash-based change detection eliminates expensive re-analysis
**Application**: Content hashing built into all storage operations
